    Brief test code for sending a world snapshot to clients
    
    Wrote very brief code that parses entities into byte[] to be sent to clients to be unwrapped and instantiated, currently many problems occure, such as clients being unable to interpolate with their client-side physics with maths going to infinity for unknown reason.
    
    Code cleanup needs to be done in the byte parsing.

    Made all EntityObjects and EntityInteractions inherit EntityBehaviour
    
    EntityBehaviour makes sure every entity type creates its own ID on creation and removes its ID and frees it on destruction. This allows for proper tracking of entities and their interactions (such as DistanceJoints) across server and client

    Circle Colliders + Distance Joint Implemented
    
    A brief implementation of Circle Colliders and Distance Joints has been implemented to the physics system. The physics is based off of Erin Catto sequential impulse ideology. Warm Starting needs to be implemented (accumulation of impulses over frames).

    Added InternalEngine
    
    InternalEngine is the physics engine I intend to use for my project, Currently no methods are implemented.
    
    In the future I intend the engine to work only with Circle and Box colliders using GPGPU programming for performance (This can be done using implementations such as ComputeShaders in Unity) => In this way unity will be used for rendering rather than as a physics engine
    
    Currently coding it seperately, will port to Server once written and tested

    Implemented ServerBackend Code into Unity Projects
    
    Added some organisation:
    - Added events for server and client code for ease of use (OnClientConnection and OnStart)
    
    Implemented basic server communication and establishing UDP connection after successful TCP connection.
    - Implemented ServerCodes used to determine the purpose of each packet

    Fixed UDP connection: SocketException
    
    Stopped the UDP socket closing upon sockets connections being forcibly closed by clients

    Added handle for disconnection on server side
    
    Server can now disconnect, not yet tested on client side.
    
    Disconnection is not very clean when performed due to Sockets.IO error or Sockets.SocketException tho it is currently functional

    Implemented TCP and UDP connection to server
    
    UDP and TCP connections between server and client can be made.
    
    TODO:: a clean method of disconnecting and handling loss and regain of connection to clients and servers needs to be added for TCP, UDP and IPC

    Finished IPC connection libraries
    
    Added Packet class to handle parsing of data via byte arrays
    
    Implemented a server handle such that packets can be processed and managed on the main thread

    Started work on server code
    
    Added 2 new console code projects to write the server and client libraries:
      - ServerBackend houses the full library
      - ServerBackendReceiver is used to test client code from the library
    
    Current code is now able to establish IPC connection and send / reciever data => this is planned to be used when the server and client connect locally on the same machine, TCP and UDP connections will be implemented later
    
    Sending data currently just sends a couple set bytes => a Packet class template is left to implement to handle variety of data types
